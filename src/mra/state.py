"""``MigrationState`` — the agent's working memory.

A transcription of the ``mra:migration_state`` schema in ``docs/03_SRS.md``
§4.1, which is the authoritative shape (golden rule 4). Nothing is invented
here; if a field changes it changes in the SRS first and this follows.

``total=False`` because the state is filled in as the loop runs: MAP writes
``call_sites``/``dep_graph``, PLAN writes ``edit_batches``, CORRECT writes
``fix_attempts``, and every LLM call adds to ``tokens``.
