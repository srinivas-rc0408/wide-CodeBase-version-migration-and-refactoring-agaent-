"""The recovery loop: EDIT -> TEST -> CORRECT -> TEST -> ... -> green or give up.

This is FR-7 and FR-9 in one function. A plain function on purpose, and it
stayed one after P4 added the LangGraph wiring: a state machine whose
mechanics are only observable through a framework is a state machine nobody
can test. ``mra/graph.py`` routes CORRECT/TEST itself and shares only the cap
defined here; this loop is what ``mra.run`` drives and what the P3 tests
exercise directly.

Two stop conditions, both required:

* **green** — no failures and no errors. Done.
* **capped** — a failure signature has consumed ``MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS`` (NFR-1).
  The run gives up, is flagged for a human, and says which signature beat it.
  Without the cap a corrector that cannot fix a break retries forever; the
  signature (not the raw message) is what makes "the same failure again"
  decidable across runs, which is why P0 normalized it so aggressively.

Every round is snapshotted before the corrector runs, so a corrective patch
that touches the test oracle is reverted rather than merely reported (NB-4).
