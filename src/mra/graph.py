"""The agent as an explicit LangGraph state machine (docs/04 §2.3-2.4).

``MAP -> PLAN -> EDIT -> TEST -> {CORRECT | next batch | done}``, over
``MigrationState`` (SRS §4.1), checkpointed to ``runs/<run_id>/state.db``.

**The checkpointer is the audit log.** No node keeps its own list of what
happened; each one writes a single-slot ``note`` describing the step it just
took, and the checkpointer persists one state snapshot per step. The trajectory
is then *reconstructed* by walking that history — which node was next, what the
state looked like after it ran, when. Delete the database and the log is gone,
because there is no second copy of it anywhere.

Two places where the implementation departs from the pseudocode in docs/04,
both because the pseudocode cannot run as written:

* ``route_after_test`` in §2.3 increments ``state["current_batch"]`` inside the
  router. A LangGraph router receives a read-only view and returns an edge
  name; it has no channel to write to, so the increment would be silently
  dropped and every run would re-edit batch 0 forever. The counter is advanced
  by ``edit_node`` instead. The routing *decision* is identical.
* §2.4 wires both terminal branches straight to ``END``. The verdict then has
  nowhere to be recorded, since only a node can write to state, so both route
  through a ``finish`` node that stamps ``done`` and ``outcome`` and ends.
